# Deep-Learning---Churn-Predicition
The goal of this project is to predict, using the above-mentioned data, whether a client will deposit or withdraw funds from their portfolio – a binary classification problem. The target variable considered for this project was based on the column “Net Amount” which represents the difference between the total amount of deposits and withdrawals.
By predicting these outcomes, it is possible, for the investment company to tailor their customer retention strategy, according to each client’s probability of churn and to possibly avoid the clients’ withdrawal movements from the company’s account. Also, even if the outcome of the model is positive – this is, the client is predicted not to withdraw money – the company can act in order to persuade the client to increase their wallet share.
